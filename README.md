<h1>Hi, my name is Beatrice Stanila ☺️</h1>
<h4>Aspiring Software Developer</h4>
</div>

<hr>

Back in high-school I wrote my first "Hello World!" in C++. However, my goal was to help people and make a difference in their life, so I become a pharmacist 🎓🥼🧪. Even though being a pharmacist is a rewarding and challenging career, it was not a good fit for me. Exploring other careers, I realized that a software developer can also make a positive impact on people's life by creating software solutions that help solve problems. Now, I'm a student at the School of Code Bootcamp 👩🏻‍💻.

If I'm not coding you'll probably find me working out or trying out new sports ⛸️💃🏻🧗🏻‍♀️!

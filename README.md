<h1>Hi, My name is Beatrice, but friends call me Bea ☺️</h1>

<h4>I'm a student at the School of Code Bootcamp. 🚀</h4>

<hr>

Back in high-school I wrote my first <h5>Hello World!</h5> in C++. However, my goal was to help people and make a difference in their life, so I become a pharmacist 🎓🥼🧪. Even though being a pharmacist is a rewarding and challenging career, it was not a good fit for me. Exploring other careers, I realized that a software developer can also make a positive impact on people's life by creating software solutions that help solve problems.

If I'm not learning how to code you'll probably find me working out or trying out new sports ⛸️💃🏻🧗🏻‍♀️! You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/BeatriceStanila">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BeatriceStanila">Twitter</a>.
